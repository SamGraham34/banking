This project is to create a thorough set of unit tests for the banking package.  Create skeleton classes with stub methods.  No need to make a banking simulation program.  Use the zip file that the professor put on the project page.

Initial Tests Are Split Up As:

Sam - Bank and Account
Myrlene - Customer and Saving Account
