# Agnes, Myrlene, Chris and Sam

This project is to create a thorough set of unit tests for the banking package.  Create skeleton classes with stub methods.  No need to make a banking simulation program.  Use the zip file that the professor put on the project page.

Tests should be looked at and verified by all team members.

Write Javadocs describing what the test should accomplish.

Initial Tests Are Split Up As:

Sam - Bank and Account

Myrlene - Customer and Saving Account
